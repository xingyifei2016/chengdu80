<h2>Features of FREE</h2>
    
<p>We provide two ways of searching, by researchers or by fields. Our search is lightning fast and each page contains rich information regarding the desired unit.</p> <h3 id="h3-search-for-researchers"><a name="Search for Researchers" class="reference-link"></a><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Search for Researchers</h3><p>Please use <a href="/search/">this link</a> to jump to the researcher search page. Alternatively, you may click "Search by Name" on the top menu bar.</p> <p>You may search your desired researcher based on his / her name, institute affiliation, and / or expertise. For example, if you are interested in Professor <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/denero.html">John Denero</a> of <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/"> Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department</a> in <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>, you may input "John Denero" in the Name field, "Berkeley" in Institute field and "Computer Science" in the Expertise field. And the first returned unit is Professor John Denero`s page in FREE engine. </p> <p>If instead of identifying the information of an exact Professor, you want to explore Professors in certain expertise. FREE also gets you covered! For example, you may simply type "financial engineering" in Expertise to get a list of Professors who work in this field. And if you want to specify Professors in University of California, Berkeley working on financial engineering, you may input "financial engineering" in Expertise and "berkeley" in Institute. Good luck exploring!</p> <p>You may take a look at a sample page <a href="/search/John%20DeNero/?authorID=2936600175">here</a>.</p> <h3 id="h3-search-for-fields"><a name="Search for Fields" class="reference-link"></a><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Search for Fields</h3><p>Please use <a href="/searchField/">this link</a> to jump to the field search page.

Here, we only include category and sub-category. For example, if you are interested in quantitative economics and especially single equation methods, you may input "quantitative" in Field and "single equation" in Subfield.</p> <p>You may take a look at a sample page of a field`s page <a href="/searchField/Agricultural%20and%20Natural%20Resource%20Economics;%20Environmental%20and%20Ecological%20Economics~Energy/?id=Q40&field=Agricultural%20and%20Natural%20Resource%20Economics;%20Environmental%20and%20Ecological%20Economics&subfield=Energy">here</a>.</p> <h3 id="h3-trending-researchers"><a name="Trending Researchers" class="reference-link"></a><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Trending Researchers</h3><p>This area denotes the mostly searched researchers from all FREE users.
