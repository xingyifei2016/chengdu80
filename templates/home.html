<h2>Overview</h2>
UC Berkeley’s team is pleased to present FREE, an open-sourced financial researcher search engine. FREE utilizes advanced techniques including but not limited to: unsupervised statistical learning, knowledge graph embedding and network analysis. Our project started with the meticulous processing and exploratory analysis of the provided scholar and publication data. This involved categorizing all research into various fields and establishing an appropriate hierarchy of fields for all of the research using natural language processing. With the processed data, we then constructed a collaboration network of the scholars, allowing us to derive several different metrics on researcher collaboration and relative importance of scholars. For any given researcher, a user can get information on all of the researcher’s relevant publications, his or her research domains, citation statistics, and coauthors among others. These metrics, in conjunction with interactive visualizations, would allow a user to effortlessly learn about any field and the trends, structure, and top researchers that characterize that field.
